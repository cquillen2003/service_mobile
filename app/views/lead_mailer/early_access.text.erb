Hi,

Thank you for registering for early access to ServiceBase.

The application is online and is currently in beta.  The current focus
is on getting real-world feedback and making refinements to the user interface,
primarily the inspection and proposal forms.

If you are interested in a 10 to 15 minute web-conference demo in the next
few weeks, please let me know so that we can get that scheduled.  Also,
please let me know if you have any questions or other feedback.

Best,

Corey Quillen
